# KNN-from-scratch
This project is about creating a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm using Python, NumPy, and Pandas. It's a hands-on approach to understanding machine learning, where we'll implement k-NN without specific ML libraries, using NumPy for math operations and Pandas for data handling.
